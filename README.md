# Project Title: Commodity-classifier (HS code predictor)

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
# Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 
The project is about building a classifier to evaluate the correctness of the HS codes declared during the import into the state. The classifier uses the declared HS code and commodity description for correctness evaluation. Using the publicly available Universal Sentence Encoder and pre-trained Google sentence to vector model, the classifier can calculate the HS code based on the commodity description and then compare it with the declared HS.

## Background

# Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

The idea can help in solving multiple problems arising in relation to the importation of goods, in particular:
* it can help prevent deliberate fraud on imported goods;
* identify misdeclared goods due to unintended errors;
* help importers in selecting correct product groups, HS codes, from the the Harmonized System (HS) while declaring goods. 

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
